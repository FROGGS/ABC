This module is the beginning of a set of tools for dealing with ABC music
files in Perl 6.

The most useful standalone tool here is the abc2ly script, which converts ABC
files to Lilypond format, allowing you to create beautiful PDF sheet music.

As of 11/29/2011, this works on the latest Rakudo nom, and on the old 7/11 Rakudo Star.
