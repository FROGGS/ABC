This module is the beginning of a set of tools for dealing with ABC music
files in Perl 6.

The most useful standalone tool here is the abc2ly script, which converts ABC
files to Lilypond format, allowing you to create beautiful PDF sheet music.

    env PERL6LIB=/Users/colomon/tools/ABC/lib: perl6 bin/abc2ly.pl <frip.abc >frip.ly

or

    mono /Users/colomon/tools/niecza/run/Niecza.exe -Ilib bin/abc2ly.pl <frip.abc >frip.ly

As of 5/6/2012, this works on the 2/12 Rakudo or the 5/12 Niecza.
